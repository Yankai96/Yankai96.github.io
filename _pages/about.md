Hey, Iâ€™m Yankai Jiang, a researcher at the AI for Science Center, Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.

I obtained my Ph.D. from the College of Computer Science and Technology at Zhejiang University, under the supervision of Prof. Hai Lin. My research interests include multimodal large language models, vision-language pretraining, self-supervised learning, zero-shot learning, open-vocabulary segmentation, and medical image analysis.
